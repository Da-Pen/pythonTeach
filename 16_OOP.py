# Ideas for examples: pet, athlete, singer

# Let's say that I want to create a few pets



# explain that classes are used to represent real-life objects
# explain: class vs object
# explain attributes and methods

# create Pet class:
#  - What are the properties of a Pet?
#  - What are the things that a Pet can do?


# UPDATE: Explain with pygame
# class PetAnswer:
#     def __init__(self, name, species, age, color):
#         self.name = name
#         self.species = species
#         self.age = age
#         self.color = color
#
#     def increase_age(self):
#         self.age += 1
#         print(f"{self.name} just turned {self.age}!")
#
#     def
#
#     def description(self):
#         return f"{self.name} is a {self.age} year-old {self.color} {self.species}"
